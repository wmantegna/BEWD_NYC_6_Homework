Mission Statement
------------------------------------
I have a dream, that one day brewers everywhere will have the ability to easily share data about their brews across the World Wide Web!

Core Functionality
------------------------------------
--Menu:
	User Profile Page
	Search (users/beers)
	About Us
	Resources
	
--User Profile Page: 
	DisplayName (screen name)
	Total beers made
	Favorites section (beer, beer style, food, bar)
	Links to other brewing-related accounts
	List of last 5 beers a brewer has made (with link to all beers a user has logged)

--Beer Profile Page: Displays information about each brew, as logged by the user.
	Name
	Style
	Brew Set-up (drop-down: Extract, Partial-mash, All-Grain)
	Recipe: (Link)
	Original Gravity (OG)
	Final Gravity (FG)
	ABV ( ~ can be calculated on back-end)
	Date Brewed
	Racking Dates (optional)
	Priming Process
	Date Bottled
	Brewer Rating
	
--Resources Page: Search feature to find information on each style of beer
	--Interface with BreweryDB (database will be downloaded, and I will write functions to improve the ability to sort through the data in this database)
	--OR Interface with RateBeer.com API

--'About Us' Page: Displays information about this project, starting with the mission statement above.


(after core functionality is built)
Desirable Features:
------------------------------------
--User Profile Picture
--Profile Photo for each beer that relates to the style of beer selected
--Ability to upload a photo for each Beer
--Resources Page Expansion: List other websites / links to pages that have useful information for every brewer
	--Priming sugar calculator's
	--Forum's (HomeBrewTalk)
	--Recipes (BrewToad)
	--Popular blogs
--External Sharing: Users can share a new brew via Twitter/Facebook (maybe instagram?)


Development Milestones:
------------------------------------
Core Functionality
------------------
#1 = Rails project, Git repo, homepage, basic menu with working links to basic pages
#2 = User model & controller, CRUD for User (scoped to each user's data), log-in/-out, profile page
#3 = Styles model (& 1 row of dummy data), Beers model, CRUD for Styles and Beer (scoped where necessary), Create a new beer, beer profile page
#4 = Specific functions for each model so that user/beer information can be viewed
#5 = Replace dummy Styles with breweryDB styles

Desirable Features
------------------
#1 = Figure out uploading photos (maybe us a 3rd party)
#2 = User Profile Photo
#3 = Beer Profile Photo
#4 = Resources Expansion
#5 = UI improvements using CSS
#6 = External Sharing
#7 = UI/front-end funcationality improvements using JQuery/AJAX

Features That I won't have time for until after BEWD
------------------------------------
--Beer Page ~ Recipe:
	Expand this from a simple link to a view into 
--Feature Requests/User Feedback System
--Badge system: Similar to FourSquare, Untappd, etc
